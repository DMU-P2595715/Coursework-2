              <p class="cast"><b>Ren Gill</b> is known as the front-man of the band with a range of musical talents from singing, songwriting and the ability to play practically any instrument you put in front of him. The 30 year-old has always had a passion for music however, his early career was quickly cut short when his body had been ravaged by Lyme Disease. Ren was (and still is) widely known for his fantastic busking around the streets of Brighton and at 25 he had been scouted by Sony after they had seen him perform. Ren was an incredibly healthy and active man, however shortly after he was signed he woke up one morning thinking he'd had the worst hangover he'd ever experienced; however, this was not the case. He started to develop flu-like symptoms as well as panic attacks which had been diagnosed as depression and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome but Ren wasn't so sure, he had spent years trying to deduce what was happening to him until he visited a specialist in Brussels who diagnosed him with the bacterial infection Lyme Disease. Ren had been left bedbound for up to 23 hours a day stating that his life changed overnight, going from an incredibly happy and healthy young man to a shellof his former self. This caused Sony to be forced to drop the young artist who was severely struggling in all aspects of his life, but depsite being left with no energy Ren said that making music from his bdeside is what kept him sane
              <br>
              <br>
              Ren spent many hard, long years recovering and eventually underwent a stem cell transplant that bought him back to the world. During a time where he was bedridden and stuck in isolation Ren produced music that many people resonated with, writing about illness, depression and isolation, his words struck a chord with people in simialr situations. This combined with his unique music style and striking vocals creates a mastermind within music who has been spurred on by his fanbase to continue to create and share his raw but real music.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
              Not only has Ren created a massive following for himself, quickly after his recovery he formed a band with his friends Glen, Gorran and Romain where they are constantly seen busking around the streets of Brighton. As much as Ren appreciates the ability to create music in his own, his love for music also stems from the connection that is creates between people; Ren realised that he wanted to share his talents within a band rather than go it alone. Ren has produced many amazing pieces in all aspects of hs career and has much more to give to world.

               <br>
                 <b>Romain Axisa</b> is a French artist who is a magician with the guitar, creating riffs and melodies as effortlessly as if he were just speaking. Romain first began playing guitar when he was 12 and quickly became obssessed, he began to forget about all of his other hobbies, interests and even schoolwork as he became devoted to progessing his skills going as far as playing 7 hours a day. Romain quickly realised what he wanted to do with his life, he wanted to make music; after his studies Romain worked as a bartender for a year before moving to England to pursue his dream. This is when he met the other members of the band and they decided to begin busking, everytime they went out and perfromed on the streets they managed to form huge crowds of people and Romain knew he had something special, he knew the band was going to go far.
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             Romain knew he had talents within the band but he also realised he had visions for music that would better suit a one man performace; just like Ren, Romain has produced tons of his own, independant work which has gained a large following. Branching off from the classic british rock that the band produces, Romain creates more emotional, slower-paced music that resonates with his audience on a level that is hard for an artist to achieve
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             Romain loves the connection he has with his bandmates, he believes that the band has so much to give to the world "It's a great thing because we always have songs! So many songs…”, “everyone brings their own thing.” The band orginally making a name for themsleves by performing covers which isn't something they wanted to be known for, they're all amazing songwriters and Romain wanted to prove his skills to the world by creating his own music.

                   <b>Gorran Kendall</b> is the third member of the band also equiped with a range of talents across numerous difeerent instruments, however his main role is singer, rythm guitarist and harmonicist. Gorran met his band mates through chance, just busking on the streets of brighton, and as fate would have it they decided to start busking together. As Gorran explains "<i>it just started becoming a regular thing at the beach during the summer, we were just jamming, then one time after Pride we were like let’s go out and bring Ren’s drum kit, that will be a laugh, we were just pissing around in the street. In the weeks that followed, we kept doing it and people were coming up to us asking what we were called and we were like what? We’re not a band," he laughs, "So then we were like… hey, we should be a band!</i>".
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               Gorran is a songwriter, like his other bandmates and he creates music on his own as well as within the band. He has released music on Youtube and Spotify, he has also done promotional content for the music store GAK alongside Romain which has helped grow his audience.
